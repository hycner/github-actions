# github-actions
Testing things with GitHub actions

### NOTES
- The `build` folder contains any temporary files / artifacts

### EXAMPLES
- `approval.yml` - Manual approval
    - This requires `environments` to be set up on the repo
- `artifacts.yml` - Passing artifacts between jobs
- `env-vars.yml` - Using environment variables
- `os.yml` - Different operating systems on different steps
